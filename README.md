# AI Governance Evaluator (Sample Project)

This project demonstrates how LLM outputs can be evaluated for governance using custom criteria such as bias, safety, and relevance.

## Features

- Simulates evaluation of prompt/response pairs using rule-based scoring
- Includes post-inference policy checks (e.g., PII leakage, hallucination risk)
- Easy to extend with additional evaluators or pipeline integrations

## Use Cases

- Demonstrates your thinking around LLM governance, scoring, and mitigation
- Great for technical interviews or showing stakeholder-friendly artifacts
- Includes safe, simulated data only (no IP)
